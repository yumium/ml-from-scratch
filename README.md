# ml_from_scratch
Analogous to the key algorithms repo, this repo contains key ML models and algorithms implemented from scratch

## Why ML from scratch?
- Forces you to understand what's going on under the hood
- Which makes you better at debugging ML algorithms (long training time, model not learning, numerical errors etc.)

TO DO:
- [ ] KNN
- [ ] 2-layer NN
- [ ] SVMs
- [ ] CNNs
- [ ] RNNs
- [ ] Transformer
